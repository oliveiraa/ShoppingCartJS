This project goal is to create a shopping cart "widget" front-end using JQuery and KnockoutJS.

The requirements are :
  * A simple clickable area at the bottom of the page to expand the widget
  * The widget must scroll sideways to allow the user to see all the items
  * Adding items to the cart should be as simple as Cart.Add(jsonObj);

There are lot's of open questions on how things will be done, but I plan to keep this repository updated as I go.
I'll also try to create a simple documentation as the project evolves.
